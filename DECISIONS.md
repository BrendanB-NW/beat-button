## ADR-004: State Management Strategy

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Project Team  

### Context
DAW applications require complex state management for projects, tracks, notes, playback state, and UI state.

### Decision
Use **Zustand** with **Modular Store Architecture**:
- Separate stores for different domains (project, audio, ui, theory)
- Immutable updates with Immer integration
- Persistent storage for project data using browser localStorage
- Real-time synchronization between audio engine and UI state

### Rationale
- **Simplicity**: Zustand is simpler than Redux for this project scale
- **Performance**: Fine-grained reactivity prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Developer Experience**: Less boilerplate than Redux, better than Context API
- **Persistence**: Built-in persistence support for project saving

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Fast development, good performance, simple debugging
- **Negative**: Less ecosystem than Redux, team needs to learn Zustand patterns
- **Risks**: Large project state could impact performance without proper optimization

## ADR-005: Testing Strategy

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Project Team  

### Context
Audio applications are complex and require comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability and performance.

### Decision
Implement **Multi-Layer Testing Strategy**:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for services, utilities, and pure functions (70% of coverage)
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library for UI components (20% of coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Service interaction and data flow testing (8% of coverage)
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical user workflows (2% of coverage)
- **Performance Tests**: Custom benchmarks for audio latency and UI responsiveness

### Rationale
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple test layers catch different types of issues
- **Pyramid Structure**: More unit tests, fewer E2E tests for efficiency
- **Audio-Specific**: Performance tests crucial for real-time audio applications
- **Maintainability**: Focus on testing public interfaces rather than implementation

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High confidence in releases, catches regressions early
- **Negative**: Significant testing overhead, slower feature development initially
- **Risks**: Audio testing in headless environments is challenging

## ADR-006: Project Data Storage Strategy

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Project Team  

### Context
Users need to save projects locally and export audio files. Must handle both structured project data and binary audio data.

### Decision
Implement **Hybrid Storage Approach**:
- **Project Metadata**: Browser localStorage for project structure, settings, and note data
- **Audio Export**: Generate files client-side using Web Audio API rendering
- **Session State**: sessionStorage for temporary playback state
- **Future Extension**: IndexedDB for large projects or audio samples

### Rationale
- **No Server Required**: Fully client-side reduces complexity and privacy concerns
- **Fast Access**: localStorage provides immediate project loading
- **User Control**: Users own their data completely
- **Export Flexibility**: Client-side rendering allows multiple export formats

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Simple deployment, user privacy, no server costs
- **Negative**: Storage limitations, no cross-device sync initially
- **Risks**: Browser storage limits could impact large projects

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Project Team  

### Context
DAW interfaces are complex with many specialized components. Need maintainable, testable, and reusable component structure.

### Decision
Implement **Domain-Driven Component Architecture**:
```
components/
├── common/          # Reusable UI primitives
├── daw/             # DAW-specific components
├── theory/          # Music theory components
└── synthesis/       # Audio synthesis components
```

Each domain has its own component patterns and testing strategies.

### Rationale
- **Domain Separation**: Clear boundaries between different application areas
- **Reusability**: Common components prevent duplication
- **Testability**: Domain-specific components can be tested in isolation
